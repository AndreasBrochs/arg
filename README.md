Auth0, React and GraphQL





**Backend:**

To test the auth0 in Playground add your token in the "HTTP HEADERS" tab in the bottom left in this format:

{ "authorization": "Bearer < YOUR TOKEN >" }

A test token can be found at auth0.com. Navigate to "Applications/APIs" click on your API Project and then the Test-tab.
